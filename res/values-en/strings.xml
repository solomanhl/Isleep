How to choose and use a pillow, naturally became the babys top priority. Mom in the choice of pillows, should pay attention to the height, width, length, but also the pillowcases, pillow materials and hardness, and so on. Width equal to the width of babys shoulders is appropriate, or slightly wider; the height of three or four months baby is 1-2cm; after 6 months one is about 3-4cm; 3 years older one is about 6-9cm. \nNewborn babies dont usually need to use pillow, because the head size of newborn is almost equal to shoulder width. Lie on your back, back and head on the same plane; Side, head and body are in the same plane. But if the mattress is very soft , when the day is cold, you go to sleep or spilled milk, mother can fold in half twice of the towel , pad at the bottom of the babys head. Or let the baby lie on their right side, and use the upper part of the folded towel to pad slightly higher \nWhen little babies grow up to three months or so, learned to look upward, after that physiological cervical spine appears bent forward.
